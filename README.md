### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**AntonioMirarchi/AntonioMirarchi** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I started my career at AddLab for which I worked in the development of pharmaceutical products and more specifically, nano-systems for drug delivery. I then started working in a computational area, in which I learnt the extreme potential of Machine Learning (ML) by successfully developing a model able to predict the redox potential of flavoproteins starting from a PDB file.

I am currently looking for the right doctorate position from which I would like to develop and enhance my current skills and knowledge, as well as a possible idea for a project: a ML model able to predict the degree of affinity (pharmacodynamics) between small molecules and specific receptors of which the alteration is considered to be foundation of rare illness. 

My long-term career goal would be to develop new computational tools to overcome the slowest process of drug development and to maintain at the same time the safety of drugs.
