### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started my career at AddLab for which I worked in the development of pharmaceutical products, and more specifically, nano-systems for drug delivery. After ny gradution, I decided to move to the computational area at Unimib, and there I learnt the extreme potential of Machine Learning (ML) by successfully developing a model able to predict the redox potential of flavoproteins starting from a PDB file.

I am currently a researcher in the computational biophysics laboratory at PRBB where I have the opportunity to improve my coding skills and deep learning knowledge with a focus in the drug-design/drug-development field.

My long-term career goal would be to develop new generalized computational tools to overcome the slowest process of drug development and to maintain at the same time the safety of drugs.
